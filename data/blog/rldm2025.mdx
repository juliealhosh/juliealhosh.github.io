    Last month, I had the pleasure of attending RLDM 2025, held in Dublin, Ireland. RLDM brought together a global community of researchers, professors, and students from diverse fields including AI, neuroscience, psychology, robotics, and more.

This year’s event was particularly meaningful to me because I presented my work for the first time. It was a week filled with insightful talks, thought-provoking discussions, and inspiring encounters.

    One of the highlights was presenting my paper, [Tractable Representations for Convergent Approximation of Distributional HJB Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05563). This paper provides Sharing this research and getting feedback from conference attendees was an incredibly rewarding experience.

### Highlights from the Conference

RLDM 2025 was packed with compelling talks and poster sessions. A few personal highlights included:

**Wei Ji Ma** on Human planning and memory in combinatorial games
**Doina Precup** on making artificial RL agents closer to natural ones
**Michael Bowling and Esraa Elelimy** on Rethinking the Foundations for Continual Reinforcement Learning
**David Abel et al.** on Agency is Frame-Dependent
**Claire Vernade** on Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning with Memory Traces


### Meeting the Community

RLDM offers a unique opportunity where early-career researchers can genuinely connect with senior researchers. I especially enjoyed taling to Prof. Michael Bowling, Claire Vernade and many friends I met there. TODO polaroid


### A Bit of Exploration

Outside the venue, I also got a chance to explore Dublin, . I even managed to visit to Cliffs of Moher, and yes, they are even more gorgeous in person!

### Looking Ahead

A big thank you to the organizers, participants, volunteers, and everyone who made the event such a success.

If you're interested in reinforcement learning, neuroscience, robotics, or decision theory, I can’t recommend RLDM enough.
