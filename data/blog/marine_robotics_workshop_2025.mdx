I had the incredible opportunity to participate in a marine robotics workshop Jan 17-24,2025 at Bellairs Research Institute in Holetown, Barbados. This was my third time attending, and probably—unfortunately—my last. The event brought together researchers from many universities, a few industry professionals, and plenty of hands-on experiments with cutting-edge robotic systems. It was an unforgettable experience filled with teamwork, learning, and of course, a few surprises along the way!

# Pushing the Limits of Marine Robotics

Throughout the workshop, teams worked on **[Aqua2](https://www.independentrobotics.com/aqua2), [BlueBoat](https://bluerobotics.com/store/boat/blueboat/blueboat/), [BlueRov2](https://bluerobotics.com/store/rov/bluerov2/) and a bunch of other lab-built aquatic robots and drones**, testing their algorithms and hardware in real-world ocean conditions. It was amazing to see how different research teams approached similar challenges, sharing insights and collaborating to refine their methods.

# A Few Close Calls… and Lots of Laughs

No field experiment goes perfectly, and we had our fair share of unexpected moments. From weird software bugs to water-flooded robots. One particularly memorable incident involved **the BlueBoat driving off towards Venezuela**, which at the time was nerve-wracking but now makes for a great story. Basically, we didn't pay attention to the map scale and ended up planning a mission that was very far away. Thankfully, the team was able to catch the boat and retrieve it at the right time. These moments reminded us of the unpredictable nature of real-world testing and the importance of teamwork under pressure.

# Participating Universities and Companies

# The Spirit of Collaboration

What stood out the most was the camaraderie among participants. Each team worked side by side, troubleshooting issues, refining methodologies, and celebrating each other's successes. Even though we came from different backgrounds and institutions, we all shared a common passion for aquatic and marine robotics.

# Work Hard, Relax Harder

Of course, it wasn’t all just work! After long days of trials and troubleshooting, we had time to unwind on the beach, watch breathtaking sunsets, and soak in the beauty of Barbados before attending the day's talks. Some of my favorite moments included long conversations after the talks, where we got to know each other beyond our research interests.

# Looking Ahead

As the workshop wrapped up, we left with new ideas, potential collaborations, and a renewed excitement for the future of marine robotics. I’m grateful to **Gregory Dudek and Laurena Deligny** for putting together such a fantastic experience, and I can’t wait to see how our projects evolve from here!
