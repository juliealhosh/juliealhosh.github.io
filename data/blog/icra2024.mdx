# Introduction  
I had the incredible opportunity to attend the **International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024** in Yokohama, Japan, a gathering of some of the brightest minds in robotics. It was my first time at ICRA, and it turned out to be an unforgettable experience, blending cutting-edge research, inspiring conversations, and the chance to explore Japan‚Äôs rich culture. Here‚Äôs a recap of my time at the conference and the adventures that followed!

# Papers That Caught My Eye üìÑ  
ICRA featured an incredible range of papers, but a few stood out. Here‚Äôs a selection of the ones I found most fascinating (with links where available):  

1. **[Globally Stable Neural Imitation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04118)**
   This paper introduced a framework for globally stable neural imitation policies, ensuring robust and reliable performance when training robots to mimic human or expert demonstrations. It‚Äôs a step forward in creating safer and more predictable robotic systems.  

2. **[Reinforcement Learning for Blind Stair Climbing with Legged and Wheeled-Legged Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06143)**  
   This work tackled the challenging problem of teaching robots to climb stairs without relying on vision. The combination of legged and wheeled-leg robots demonstrated impressive versatility and adaptability.

    <div className="item-body mr-30">
        This paper stole the show with its fun demo: a blob-like robot that expanded, contracted, and moved around in the most entertaining way! Watching its movement was both amusing and intriguing. Unfortunately, I cannot find a link but I have this photo of the poster.

4. **[Low-to-High Resolution Path Planner for Robotic Gas Distribution Mapping](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10610044)**  
   A fascinating approach to environmental monitoring, this paper presented a path planner capable of efficiently mapping gas distributions by transitioning between low-resolution and high-resolution data. It ties closely to my own research on adaptive sampling in aquatic environments.

# Exploring Japan: Beyond the Conference üéå  
While ICRA was the main event, exploring Japan was an adventure of its own. Yokohama is 30min away from Tokyo so I got to experience both cities. I also visited Kyoto. From the serene **Fushimi Inari Taisha and Senso-ji Temple** to the bustling streets of **Shibuya and Ginza**.  

## A Few Highlights:  
- **Local Cuisine üçõ**: I enjoyed curries and tempura, discovered the [most amazing mochi on Earth](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wikrJDvFitY7ZwZ47) and to my surprise, fell in love with their strong ginger ale. It‚Äôs nothing like the mild versions I was used to ‚Äî the intense ginger kick was so refreshing.  
- **Fascinating buildings üåÜ**: I visited Tokyo SkyTree and Shibuya Sky and watching the city stretch out in every direction was an unforgettable experience
- **Hachik≈ç Statue üêï**: In Shibuya, I couldn‚Äôt miss the chance to visit the iconic Hachik≈ç statue. The story of the loyal Akita who waited for his owner every day.
