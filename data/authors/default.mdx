ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Julie, a dedicated Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) researcher pursuing an MSc in Computer Science at McGill University under the guidance of Prof. David Meger. My expertise lies in RL, distributional RL, continuous-time RL, optimal control, and robotics. Proficient in Python, C/C++, and key ML libraries. I'm also working on a robotics research project using BlueBoat, an autonomous surface vehicle (more on that soon!). I'm passionate about bridging theory and practice in ML and RL and am open to exciting career opportunities in this field.

- ðŸš€ Currently working on a gym environment that simulates an autonomous surface vehicle equiped with a winch trying to survey an area in order to reconstruct the map of a certain quality of interset, such as the depth of thermoclines

- ðŸ’¬ In my free time, I swim and watch stand-up comedy
